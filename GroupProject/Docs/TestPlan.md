# Test Plan

**Author**: Team 4

**Version**: 1.5
## 1 Testing Strategy

### 1.1 Overall Strategy
- We will test each class to verify that each unit works individually, the processes between each unit to verify that the relationship of each process is correct, the system of the design to verify that the whole system works, and the system of the design against the requirements to validate the system.

### 1.2 Test Selection
- We will use white-box techniques for the unit and integration tests as the app is developed. We will use white-box and black-box techniques for system and validation testing.

### 1.3 Adequacy Criterion
- We will be assessing the white-box test cases using key values representing possible sets of inputs for expected results and boundary cases. For black-box testing, we will be testing against the design and requirements formed by the team's analysis.

### 1.4 Bug Tracking
- Bugs and enhancements will be tracked informally in a separate document in the repository.

### 1.5 Technology
- Manual testing will be used.
